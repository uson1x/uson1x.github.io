For a couple of months, I’ve been tracking my time during the weekdays. I tried to track as much as I could, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed.

Let’s go over an 11 week period and see what’s interesting in there, shall we?

Eating
===
One of the most surprising findings for me was that I spend so much time on food. On average, every weekday I spend
* 45 minutes cooking
* 1 hour 10 minutes consuming food
* 10 minutes shopping at a supermarket
* 8 minutes unloading and loading dishwasher
* 5 minutes on breaks to eat or drink something
So it’s 2 hours and 18 minutes every day to food-related things.

But this time includes our evening dinners with my wife, which are deliberately slow. Without it, it would hover around 1.5 hours every day.

Transportation
===
Thankfully, I work mostly from home, so I don’t have those commute hours that many people have. That allowed me to spend only 12 minutes every weekday when I had to transport myself somewhere.

Work
===
Pure working hours on my day job took around 6.5 hours every day.

Other
===
32 minutes every weekday in a shower or doing other stuff I have to do to keep my body clean
9 minutes doing sports
18 minutes playing video games
10 minutes mindlessly surfing web and social networks (could be more, but that’s what I tracked like wasted time for sure)

Conclusion
===
Overall, that is a fun and insightful exercise I do once in a while. I feel like for me, the most interesting effects of it are:
You realize how scarce your time is. Outside of a day job, there are only a few hours each day you can allocate to whatever you want.
It makes you more aware of the time at every moment of your life. You wait in a queue of the post office somewhere and boom, 15 minutes of your life are gone.
For time tracking I used the app called Toggl — Free Time Tracking Software. It had quite a lot of UI issues during the iOS 12 Beta period, but seem to work better now.
